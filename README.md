In the shadowed silence of the digital expanse, there exists a ferryman—Charon. Forged in Rust and tempered by the flow of endless requests, Charon stands at the riverbanks of the interwebs, offering passage across its turbulent streams. Every packet, every connection, every whispered request is but a coin placed in his outstretched hand. Do as you wish, traverse the endless waters, command the tides of data—but remember, in the end, you are nothing more than a passenger, crossing the river of interwebs under the watchful gaze of Charon.
